# 🎥🍿InScene_ver1 A LightWeight FRPipeline for In-Scene🎞️ Actor Recognition🤔
This repo presents a lightweight face recognition pipeline which can be (in movies and TV shows) in the wild. This work is inspired by the **"X-Ray"** feature on **Amazon Prime video** which gives the viewer - the name and the profile of **all highlighted actors** in a scene when the **pause button** is pressed.

# Overview of the pipeline

## 🚀 Features

* **MTCNN-based face crop extraction**: Accurate multi-scale face extraction **In the Wild!**.
* **Dlib embeddings**: **128D face feature vectors** for robust recognition.
* **Actor recognition**: Match faces against a pre-registered set of actors to output the identities of all **highlighted actors** present in a scene.
