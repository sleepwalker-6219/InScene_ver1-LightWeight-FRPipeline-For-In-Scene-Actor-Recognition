# InScene_ver1-LightWeight-FRPipeline-For-In-Scene-Actor-Recognition
This repo presents a lightweight face recognition pipeline which can be used to identify "In-Scene Actors" (in movies and TV shows) in the wild. This work is inspired by the "X-Ray" feature on Amazon Prime video which gives the viewer the name and the profile of all highlighted actors in a scene when the pause button is pressed.
