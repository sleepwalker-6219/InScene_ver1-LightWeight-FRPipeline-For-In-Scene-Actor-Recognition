# 🎥🍿InScene_ver1-LightWeight-FRPipeline-For-In-Scene🎞️-Actor-Recognition🤔
This repo presents a lightweight face recognition pipeline which can be (in movies and TV shows) in the wild. This work is inspired by the **"X-Ray"** feature on **Amazon Prime video** which gives the viewer - the name and the profile of **all highlighted actors** in a scene when the **pause button** is pressed.
